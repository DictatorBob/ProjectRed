TODO:

- Upon sending broadcasts check directly with the receiver for free
  space. This should allow crafters to craft absurdly large amounts 
  of items without worrying about storage space. Items will wait until
  the crafter can manage more before sending.
  
- RoutedPayload should have a method that is called before it is nulled
  such as when the pipe is broken and it is ejected to the world.  This
  should allow routed payloads to inform their destination that they will
  not be showing up. Crafters can re-request, etc.
  
- Broadcasters should override the getPriority method to allow prioritizing
  broadcasters in request branches.
  
- Recode LinkState pathfinder for allowing a registration system for
  custom connection definitions such as TE tesseracts, etc.
